Ruby Magnets on Shoes
==================

Do you know **Ruby Magnets**?

If you don't, go to [RPCFN: Cycle Tracks (#12)](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/07/31/rpcfn-cycle-tracks-12/) and look at the challenge [PDF](http://rubylearning.com/data/hfrails_prog_challenge_without_solution.pdf).

Head First guys show you that. ;-)

This idea inspired me, so I tried to implement with [Shoes](http://shoes.heroku.com/).

Watch a tiny [online demo](http://www.rin-shun.com/shoes/ruby_magnets_on_shoes.swf.html) recorded with [CamStudio](http://camstudio.org/) and play with your own Shoes.


Conclusion
----------

This is my tiny project for celebrating [WhyDay](http://whyday.org/). :)

Let's enjoy Ruby programming with Shoes!
